Recommendations:
Add WebSocket endpoints for real-time monitoring
Implement an alert system for:
Large transactions
Unusual token movements
Price anomalies
Liquidity changes
Create visualization components for:
Token flow diagrams
Transaction networks
Market trends
Account activity heatmaps
Add analytics endpoints for:
Pattern recognition
Anomaly detection
Risk scoring
Correlation analysis

Implement integration points for:
Social media sentiment
External market data
Cross-chain monitoring












WebSocket Infrastructure
Use a WebSocket server (like Socket.IO or ws) to handle real-time connections
Create separate WebSocket channels for different types of data:
Transaction monitoring
Token movements
Price updates
Liquidity changes

Implement connection management and heartbeat mechanisms



Real-time Monitoring System
Set up background workers to continuously poll Solscan API endpoints
Implement data caching to reduce API calls
Create event emitters for different types of changes
Use Redis or similar for pub/sub pattern to distribute updates
Alert System Components
Alert Rules Engine:
Define thresholds and conditions for each alert type
Create rule templates for different scenarios
Allow dynamic rule updates
Alert Types:
Large Transactions:
Monitor transaction amounts
Set percentage-based thresholds
Track unusual patterns
Token Movements:
Track token transfers
Monitor wallet balances
Detect unusual transfer patterns
Price Anomalies:
Track price changes
Set volatility thresholds
Monitor price deviations from moving averages
Liquidity Changes:
Monitor pool reserves
Track liquidity additions/removals
Set percentage change thresholds
Notification System
Multiple notification channels:
WebSocket push notifications
Email alerts
SMS notifications
Webhook integrations
Alert severity levels
Alert grouping and deduplication
Data Storage
Time-series database for historical data
Alert history storage
User preferences and notification settings
User Interface
Real-time dashboard
Alert configuration panel
Notification preferences
Alert history view
Security Considerations
Rate limiting for WebSocket connections
Authentication for real-time channels
Data validation and sanitization
Alert verification mechanisms
Performance Optimization
Connection pooling
Data batching
Efficient data structures
Caching strategies
