Let me explain how we can implement this monitoring system using the Solscan API endpoints:
Track Liquidity Flows:
Use /market/volume to monitor volume changes across DEXs
Track /market/info for liquidity pool changes
Monitor /transaction/last for large liquidity movements
Price Movements:
Use /market/info to track price changes
Monitor /transaction/last for large trades affecting prices
Track /transaction/actions to identify price-impacting trades
Swap Activities:
Monitor /transaction/last for DEX-related transactions
Use /transaction/detail to analyze swap details
Track /transaction/actions for specific swap operations
Anomaly Detection:
Set thresholds for volume spikes using /market/volume
Monitor price deviations using /market/info
Track unusual transaction patterns with /transaction/last
Arbitrage Opportunities:
Compare prices across DEXs using /market/info
Monitor price differences in real-time
Track execution of arbitrage trades via /transaction/detail
The WebSocket service we implemented will provide real-time updates for:
Sudden volume changes
Large trades
Price movements
Liquidity changes
This data can be used to:
Trigger notifications for anomalies
Visualize liquidity changes
Identify arbitrage opportunities
Detect potential manipulations
Would you like me to explain how to set up specific monitoring thresholds or detection patterns?
